    <h1>Music Masters</h1>
    <p>Web Design</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Music Masters</strong> is a fictional online guitar shop created for a Web Design and Development course project. Our goal was to build a responsive site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a catalog of guitars and accessories. The site emphasizes user experience and product clarity.</p>

    <h2>Context, Skills, and Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>
      <li><strong>Type:</strong> Academic project (IAT 339)</li>
      <li><strong>Date:</strong> June–July 2025</li>
      <li><strong>Team:</strong> Sam (myself), Muhammad Junaid</li>
      <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer, Front-End Developer</li>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Problem or Objective</h2>
    <p>We aimed to design a professional, easy-to-use website for selling guitars online. Many competitors had cluttered interfaces or limited mobile usability, so our challenge was to create a clean and responsive experience across devices.</p>

    <h2>Design and Iteration</h2>
    <h3>Initial Iteration</h3>
    <p>I led the wireframe creation in Figma, drafting the structure for the homepage, product page, and contact section. After team feedback, I refined spacing, visuals, and hierarchy for better clarity.</p>
    <div class ="wireframe-images">
      <img class ="product-wireframe" alt ="Product Page Wireframe" src = "images/products_wireframe.png" loading ="lazy" width ="300" height="564">

      <img src = "images/contact_wireframe.png" alt ="Contact Page Wireframe" loading ="lazy" width ="300" height="257">

      <img src = "images/home_wireframe.png" alt ="Home Page Wireframe" loading ="lazy" width ="300" height="257">
  
      <img class ="bottom-wireframe" alt ="About Page Wireframe" src = "images/about_wireframe.png" loading ="lazy" width ="300" height="257">
  
      <img class ="bottom-wireframe" alt ="Styleguide Wireframe" src = "images/style_wireframe.png" loading ="lazy" width ="300" height="257">
  
      </div>

      <h3>Website Iteration</h3>
      <p>For the final website, we decided to use solid colors for more visual consistency and easier readability for users.</p>

      <div class ="final-images">
        <h4>Before</h4>
        <h4>After</h4>

        <figure>
      <img src = "images/oldSite.png" alt = "Website with old colour scheme"
        loading = "lazy" width = "600" height = "339">
        <figcaption>Original layout and gradient color scheme. Got feedback that gradient colors made visibility for navigation buttons worse</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
      <img src = "images/final_layout1.png" alt ="Music Masters Home Page" loading ="lazy" width ="600" height="339">
      <figcaption>Made color scheme solid to make layout consistent and improve visibility</figcaption>

        </figure>

      <figure>
      <img src = "images/oldSite3.png" alt = "Website with old colour scheme"loading = "lazy" width = "600" >
      <figcaption>Products page had sections for different guitar types. After testing, found it was hard to navigate between sections</figcaption>

      </figure>

      <figure>
      <img src = "images/final_layout2.png" alt ="Music Masters Product Page Filter Bar" loading ="lazy" width ="600" height="339">
      <figcaption>Added filter bars to make it easier to navigate to sections without scrolling</figcaption>

      </figure>

      <figure>
      <img src = "images/oldSite2.png" alt = "Website with old colour scheme"loading = "lazy" width = "600" >
      <figcaption>Original layout and gradient color scheme</figcaption>

      </figure>
      
      <figure>
      <img src = "images/final_layout3.png" alt ="Music Masters Product Page product layout" loading ="lazy" width ="600">
      <figcaption>Original layout and gradient color scheme</figcaption>

      </figure>

        </div>

        <h3> Responsiveness</h3>
      <p>I also designed the footer using Flexbox so that when the screen shrank, it would wrap the content.</p>
    <div class ="styleguide">
      
      <img src = "gifs/responsiveness.gif" alt ="Footer shrinking on screen" loading ="lazy" width ="900" height="280">
    </div>

    
    <h3> Hover effect</h3>
      <p>Added hover effect animations to the footer links so that users would understand it can be interacted with and clicked. </p>
    <div class ="styleguide">
      
      <img src = "gifs/hover-animation.gif" alt ="Hovering on footer links" loading ="lazy" width ="900" height="280">


      </div>
  </section>


  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>

    <p>The final site was fully responsive, visually consistent, and supported smooth interaction across desktops, tablets, and phones. Our user testing confirmed ease of navigation and positive aesthetic feedback.</p>
      
    <div class = "final-outcome">
    <img src = "gifs/final-website1.gif" alt ="Music Masters Home Page shrinking gif" loading ="lazy" width ="900" height="509">

    <img src = "gifs/final-website2.gif" alt ="Interacting with filter bar on Music Masters Product Page gif" loading ="lazy" width ="900" height="509">
  </div>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of how design and development choices affect user experience. Through wireframing and iteration, I learned the importance of planning before coding — especially how early structure can prevent issues later in the process. Designing in Figma allowed me to quickly test ideas and share them with my team, leading to faster and more confident design decisions.</p>

     <p>On the development side, working with responsive layouts using Flexbox taught me how to build flexible components that adapt well to different screen sizes. I also gained experience improving interactivity through hover states and subtle animations, which enhance usability without overwhelming the user.</p>

     <p> Another key takeaway was the importance of consistency in branding and structure — keeping fonts, colors, and layout patterns unified across the site made the interface feel more polished and professional. I realized how small design details, like padding and alignment, can significantly impact how users perceive a website.</p>
