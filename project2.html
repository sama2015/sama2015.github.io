    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This project provided insight into the process of branding design. There was an emphasis on ideation through methods such as mind maps, matrices, and drawing.</p>

    <p>In terms of technical skills, I learned how to create layouts and logos using InDesign and Illustrator, as well as kerning for my logotype.</p>

     <p>Finally, this project taught of the importance of user research. Researching the company's goals and values were necessary because they informed my design decisions. Also, this is necessary so that your design can reflect the identity of the company.</p>
